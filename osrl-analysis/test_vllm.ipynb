       "   - The tangents to the circle at points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\), making \\(BD\\) and \\(CD\\) tangents to the circle. This means \\(BD = CD\\).\n",

       "To solve the problem, we need to use some properties of circles and tangents. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Understand the Geometry:**\n",
       "   - We have a triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in a circle \\(\\omega\\).\n",
       "   - The tangents to \\(\\omega\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\).\n",
       "   - Line \\(AD\\) intersects \\(\\omega\\) at \\(P\\).\n",
       "   - We are given \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\).\n",
       "   - We need to find the length of \\(AP\\).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Use Power of a Point Theorem:**\n",
       "   - Since \\(D\\) is the intersection of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), \\(D\\) lies on the polar of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(\\omega\\). This means that \\(AD\\) is a symmedian of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n",
       "   - By the Power of a Point theorem, \\(AD \\cdot DP = BD^2 = CD^2\\).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Calculate the Lengths:**\n",
       "   - Let \\(AP = x\\) and \\(PD = y\\). Then \\(AD = x + y\\).\n",
       "   - By the Power of a Point theorem, \\(AD \\cdot DP = BD^2 = CD^2\\). Since \\(BD\\) and \\(CD\\) are tangents from \\(D\\) to the circle, they are equal in length. Let \\(BD = CD = t\\).\n",
       "   - So, \\(AD \\cdot DP = t^2\\). This gives us \\((x + y) \\cdot y = t^2\\).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Use the Symmedian Property:**\n",
       "   - Since \\(AD\\) is a symmedian, it divides the opposite side in the ratio of the squares of the other two sides. So, \\(BD/CD = AB/AC = 5/10 = 1/2\\).\n",
       "   - This means that \\(BD = CD = t\\), and since \\(BD\\) and \\(CD\\) are tangents, they are equal. So, \\(t = \\sqrt{AB \\cdot AC} = \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 10} = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}\\).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Calculate \\(AP\\):**\n",
       "   - We know that \\(AD \\cdot DP = (5\\sqrt{2})^2 = 50\\).\n",
       "   - Let \\(AP = x\\) and \\(PD = y\\). Then \\(AD = x + y\\).\n",
       "   - So, \\((x + y) \\cdot y = 50\\).\n",
       "   - We also know that \\(AP/PC = AB^2/AC^2 = 25/100 = 1/4\\). So, \\(AP = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot AC = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 10 = 2\\).\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Final Calculation:**\n",
       "   - We need to find \\(AP\\) in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\). Since \\(AP = 2\\), we have \\(m = 2\\) and \\(n = 1\\).\n",
       "   - So, \\(m + n = 2 + 1 = 3\\).\n",
